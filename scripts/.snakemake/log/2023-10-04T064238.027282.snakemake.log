MissingOutputException in rule birch_cluster_arg_Covid in line 115 of /home/zhaowany/INCAS/collective_narrative_shift/scripts/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../data/covid/derived/txSRL/birch/arg/2020-01-24_to_2020-01-24.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 18
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
